# TIW-project-2022-RIA

This project is the RIA version (the pure HTML version can be found [here](https://github.com/CarloSgaravatti/TIW-project-2022-pure-HTML.git)) of the exam assignment for the course "Tecnologie Informatiche per il web" (TIW).

The project consists of the implementation of a web application that manages documents for the users. The users can upload their documents, create directories and subdirectories, move documents across different subdirectories, and delete existing directories, subdirectories or documents by drag-and-drop into the recycling bin.
